/**
 * Handles a {@link ProvisionResponse} received from an external system.
 * <p>
 * Some provisioning responses will be asynchronously received in-process, for example, when a provisioner executes locally and returns a response via a future. In contrast,
 * a provisioner that delegates to an external system may receive a response on an asynchronous callback channel. The response therefore cannot be returned using the
 * provisioner's future as there is no guarantee the response from the external system will be routed to the originating EDC runtime.
 * <p>
 * To handle this case, the callback channel will receive the response and submit it via a {@link SingleTransferProcessCommand} and routing to the originating runtime is not
 * required.
