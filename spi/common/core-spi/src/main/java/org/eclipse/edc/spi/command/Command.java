 * <ul>
 * <li>Commands are simple POJOs, that must be (JSON-)serializable and can therefore not have references to other services.</li>
 * <li>Commands must contain all the information that a {@link CommandHandler} requires to do its job.</li>
 * <li>Commands do not have results. Any results that an operation may produce are to be handled by the {@link CommandHandler}</li>
