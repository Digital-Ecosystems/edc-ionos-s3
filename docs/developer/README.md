> All implementations have to follow existing design principles and architectural patterns that are provided as
> [Decision Records](decision-records/). Therefore, during implementation, please refer to the dedicated
> [style guide](../../styleguide.md) and [contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md), and the patterns we
> documented in [architecture principles](architecture/coding-principles.md). _Make sure to continuously
> check and extend the list._
