# OAuth 2 Provision

This BOM provides a ready-to-use version of the [Oauth2 Provision Core module](../provision-oauth2-core) including the [Oauth2 Client](../../../../common/iam/oauth2/oauth2-client)
provided by the EDC.

> **_NOTE:_**  Unless you are sure of what you are doing, you do not want to implement your own Oauth2 Client in most cases.
> This BOM should thus be considered as the standard and recommended approach of embedding the Oauth2 Provision module into your runtime.
