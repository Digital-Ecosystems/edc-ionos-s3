# OAuth 2 Service

This BOM provides a ready-to-use version of the [Oauth2 IdentityService](../oauth2-core) including the [Oauth2 Client](../oauth2-client)
provided by the EDC.

> **_NOTE:_**  Unless you are sure of what you are doing, you do not want to implement your own Oauth2 Client in most cases.
> This BOM should thus be considered as the standard and recommended approach of embedding the Oauth2 Identity Service into your runtime.
